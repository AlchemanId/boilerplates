# Boilerplates

What Is Boilerplate? The term boilerplate refers to standardized text, copy, documents, methods, or procedures that may be used over again without making major changes to the original. A boilerplate is commonly used for efficiency and to increase standardization in the structure and language of written or digital documents. This includes contracts, investment prospectuses, and bond indentures. In the field of contract law, documents contain boilerplate language, which is a language that is considered generic or standard in contracts.
